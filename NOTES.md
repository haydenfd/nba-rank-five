# Notes 

## Main page on load useEffect scenarios

- New user, new session (Init user_id, session_id)
- Old session
    - Terminated (user lost or won)
        -> How many attempts? 
        -> Maybe scores of attempts?
    - Active
        -> Guesses made? Need the previous list of guesses made to display crumbs. Initialize to players array. 
        -> No guesses made? Should be good.
